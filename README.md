## Once Upon a Time...

In a realm not so far away, there existed a kingdom of databases, each holding the keys to valuable information. The wise Database Manager was tasked with safeguarding these treasures and ensuring their integrity throughout the ages.

## The Quest Begins

Our tale begins with the **BackupDownloader**, a magical entity capable of capturing the essence of databases in ethereal backups. Armed with the enchanted `config`, including the mystical keys of `password`, `mysql_host`, and `mysql_user`, the BackupDownloader ventured into the depths of each database, crafting secure backups and storing them safely.

## The Rise of Databases

As the backups shimmered in the digital vaults, it was time for the **MySQLMigration** to shine. With the power of connection (`connect`), creation of realms (`create_schemas`), and graceful exits (`close_connection`), the MySQLMigration forged new kingdoms of databases, ensuring they were ready to welcome new data adventurers.

## The Dance of Parameters

But wait, the journey was not complete without the **SQLFileProcessor**. In the shadows of the `backups` directory, this sorcerer danced through SQL incantations, stripping away unwanted `ROW_FORMAT=FIXED` enchantments from the SQL scrolls, leaving them pure and potent for future quests.

## A Symphony of Operations

In the heart of this enchanted realm, the **Orchestrator** stood tall. With a melody of commands, it brought together our heroes â€“ the BackupDownloader, MySQLMigration, and SQLFileProcessor. With each loop through the list of databases, a new saga unfolded, ensuring the safety, vitality, and purity of the kingdom's data.

## Epilogue

And thus, dear reader, our story finds its conclusion, not in the end but in the continuity of operations. The README.md you hold is not just a guide but a chronicle of adventures past and those yet to come. May it inspire and guide you on your noble quests through the realms of databases.
